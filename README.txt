This is a proof-of-concept, minimum working product demo. Expect things to be rough around the edges and many obvious features (e.g. most sound effects, correct music) to be missing. Only a single boss battle is implemented, and it is meant to be fairly difficult. You have infinite lives in this demo.

Be warned that the game may trigger an antivirus alert or give an "unknown publisher" warning.

CONTROLS:
Arrow Keys to move.
Hold Z to move slower (useful for precise movement)
Hold X to slow light (yellow) bullets
Hold C to slow dark (green) bullets
Press ESC to pause/resume the game

Press SPACE to destroy all bullets on the screen. In a real game this would have limited uses but it is unlimited in this demo.

Press TAB to skip an attack (for testing purposes). This can be glitchy, especially when spammed.

Press any key on the starting menu to start. Press TAB instead to skip the tutorial in the beginning.
