A simple, proof-of-concept game in the "bullet hell" genre, made in the fantastic [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Made in collaboration with artist [@trife42](https://www.instagram.com/trife42/).

This is a proof-of-concept, minimum working product demo, mostly intended as a learning experience. Expect things to be rough around the edges and many obvious features (e.g. most sound effects, correct music) to be missing. Those looking into the code should also expect things to (unfortunately) be messy and poorly documented.

Only a single boss battle is implemented, and it is meant to be fairly difficult. You have infinite lives in this demo.

Be warned that the game may trigger an antivirus alert or give an "unknown publisher" warning.

CONTROLS:
- Arrow Keys to move.
- Hold Z to move slower (useful for precise movement)
- Hold X to slow light (yellow) bullets
- Hold C to slow dark (green) bullets
- Press ESC to pause/resume the game

Press SPACE to destroy all bullets on the screen. In a real game this would have limited uses but it is unlimited in this demo.

Press TAB on the title screen to skip the opening tutorial sequence. Pressing this in-game will skip a boss's attack (for testing purposes), but is very glitchy and should be used with caution.

Press any key on the starting menu to start. Press TAB instead to skip the tutorial in the beginning.
